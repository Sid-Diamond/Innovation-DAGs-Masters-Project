# Initialize the repo
git init

# Connect it to your existing GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sid-Diamond/Innovation-DAGs-Masters-Project.git

# Check what branch you're on (probably 'master' by default on Windows)
git branch
```

Before we commit anything, let's **create that .gitignore file** so you don't accidentally push stuff you don't want:

Create a file called `.gitignore` in your project root with:
```
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.ipynb_checkpoints/
*.egg-info/
.venv/
venv/

# NetLogo
*.tmp

# OS/Editor files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.swp
~$*

# Large data files (add specific patterns if needed)
*.zip
*.tar.gz

# PDFs from references (check copyright first)
# references/*.pdf  # Uncomment if you want to exclude reference PDFs

 Identifying the technologies that drive innovation often depends on expert judgment or narrow
 indicators such as citation counts, which can obscure how knowledge actually accumulates. This
 Repo houses code examining two complementary approaches to analyzing citation networks represented as
 directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The first approach, which includes main path analysis and
 criticality-based methods, traces technological progress over time by exploiting the mathematical
 properties of DAGs. The second focuses on centrality measures that quantify the importance
 of individual nodes based on their structural position. Despite their potential, systematic evaluations
 of centrality measures tailored to DAGs remain limited, with relevant research dispersed
 across ecology, social science, and bibliometrics. This research aims to establish a foundation for future
 literature assessing how these methods perform in temporally ordered networks, which in turn
 can inform the development of more rigorous ways to identify influential research contributions.

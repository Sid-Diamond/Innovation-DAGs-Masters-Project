 Nodes in a network are equivalent in terms of their internal structure: each node
 represents the same type of entity (in the simplest type of networks). However, po
sitional importance of nodes is far from equivalent: some nodes are in structurally
 important (central) parts of a network, and some are positioned in peripheral ar
eas. Centrality is a function that evaluates nodes positional importance with
 respect to the topology of the rest of the network.
 Centrality is one of the oldest, primary tools of network analysis. Bavelas
 was rst to coin the term centrality , remarking in his experiments that central
ity of a social network is related to group e ciency in problem solving [76]. The
 relation between centrality and other group processes was thoroughly studied in
 the following decades by sociologists [77; 74; 78], later adapted to other sciences.
 Centrality has found endless applications and is used to study numerous social,
 technological, transport, biological systems. To name just a few examples centrlaity is a useful tool to nd most relevant items in recommendation systems [79],
 or to understand key participants in protein-protein interaction networks [80].
 Centrality is also used in transportation networks, e.g. to understand tra c and
 congestion [81; 82]. Furthermore, it seems to be linked to socioeconomic indica
tors in air transport networks [83]. Centrality is also used to nd vulnerabilities
 in di erent types of criminal organisations [84].
 There is no strict de nition of centrality. When a node is called central, it
 is assumed to be in a structurally important part of a network. However this
 importance manifests di erently in di erent contexts. So it is not surprising that
 centrality is also evaluated in various ways. Which centrality measure to use for
 a given network then depends on what de nes an important region in a certain
 network. One measure can be useful to evaluate importance in one network, but
 it can have no meaning in another.
 For instance, consider a citation network. Recall that an edge indicates a
 citation and can only point from an older paper to a more recent one. In this
 picture, out-degree gives a citation count of a node and in-degree is equal to the
 length of paper s bibliography. In bibliometric studies, a count of papers citations
 is considered an indicator of its success or impact [85]. Conversely, to use the
 length of a bibliography would be a far more controversial quanti er of papers
 signi cance. As the length of bibliography re ects on the amount of resources
 used by the authors, it can vary vastly based on the research eld and the type
 of paper (e.g. whether it is a letter or a review). So centrality re ecting upon
 importance in one context may be less insightful in another.
 An important feature of centrality that will be studied in this chapter is that
 centrality creates an order of nodes. Centrality values of nodes are real numbers
 which can be used to order nodes from the most central to the least central.
 Generally, this order depends only on the topology of the network. DAGs are
 62
unique in that one order of nodes is quintessentially a part of the network topology
 itself (the topological order of nodes, see section 1.3.1).
 As we will see, in many cases, centrality scores are correlated with the intrin
sic topological order of nodes: old nodes are deemed to be indicated as central,
 regardless of whether they are structurally peripheral or positioned in a core area.
 So tension between the two types of node orders exists: in some cases, a node is
 central because it is important, but other nodes are central because they are
 old but not necessarily important.
 We will begin this chapter with a review of relevant centrality literature and
 will de ne centrality as a function with speci ed features. We will then create
 axioms for a function to be a centrality measure for DAGs.
 To understand the relation between the two orders of nodes in DAGs, we will
 concentrate on a quintessential feature of centrality function, namely, the neigh
bourhood inclusion preorder and its behaviour in directed networks. We
 will also show that in DAGs there are some cases when neighbourhood inclusion
 preorder need not exist, yet we can create a centrality order. It means that cen
trality order re ects on topological order of nodes. Thus we demand a second
 requirement for a useful DAG centrality measure, namely, that it also cannot be
 trivially related to topological order.
 To make use of centrality in DAGs, we will propose several methods. First,
 we will discuss an information-theoretic measure based on similarity of partial
 orders. Such tool may be used to understand whether a node, indicated as central,
 is expected to be central given its index in the topological order. We will also look
 into several variations of centrality, such as centrality based on the longest paths,
 future and past light-cones.
 63
4.2 Requirements for Centrality
 Over the years, network centrality acquired many meanings and de nitions. To
 make sense of this multitude of measures requires their classi cation and descrip
tion of its key properties. In this section we will review work done in this area.
 It is sensible to have many centrality measures, so that we would always have
 at least one centrality measure which has a meaning in our network. However, an
 ever-growing number of measures makes one sceptical about the need to contin
uously improve centrality. Very early in the formation of the topic of network
 centrality, Freeman pointed out that several measures are often only vaguely re
lated to the intuitive ideas they purport to index, and many are so complex that
 it is di cult or impossible to discover what, if anything, they are measuring [86].
 Perhaps a formal de nition of centrality is needed. Sabidussi was rst to
 formalise centrality by stating requirements for a function which takes an undi
rected network as an argument [87]. He rst pointed out that the function should
 be invariant under graph isomorphisms. Secondly, it should be monotonic under
 graph modi cation: a vertex receiving a new incident edge (via operations called
 edge addition and edge switching) can only become more central. Sabidussis
 work was followed by Nieminen, who discussed similar axiomatisation for directed
 graphs [88]. More recently, Boldi and Vigna [89] proposed axioms to characterise
 the e ect of size, density and addition of an edge in a directed network. They fo
cused on axiomatic validity of centralities applied to graphs composed of k-cliques
 making their work speci c to such type of graph. Bandyopadhyay et al. worked
 on universally applicable sets of axioms [90].
 Most axiomatic approaches are limited to centrality applied for a speci c
 network type and to date there seems to be only one key property that is an
 uncontested assertion of what centrality is, the star property, put forward by
 64
Freeman [86; 91]: a person located in the centre of a star is universally assumed
 to be structurally more central than any other person in any other position in any
 other network of similar size . A generalisation of the star property was proposed
 by Schoch and Brandes [91] as an essential criterion of any centrality measure
 neighbourhood inclusion preorder. It states that if the neighbourhood of
 a node u includes that of v, u is dominated by v. The relation
 u Nvindicates that N(u) N(v) v
 and we say that u is dominated by v.
 (4.1)
 Neighbourhood inclusion preorder can be used to de ne centrality as a func
tion acting on nodes in G in such a way that if the neighbourhood of a vertex v
 dominates that of a vertex u, then v is at least as central as u. For our purposes,
 we de ne centrality as a function C: C(Gu) R. The function must pre
serve the neighbourhood inclusion preorder: if u N v, then C(u) C(v). We
 will discuss the neighbourhood inclusion preorder in detail in section 4.5.1.
 We expect centrality to behave in the following way. The centrality score of
 a node increases if the distances between the node and the rest of the network
 decrease. Furthermore, if a graph is not strongly connected (i.e. there is at least
 one node which does not have a path to at least one other node), then the centrality
 of a node increases with the number of reachable nodes. This is often considered
 in centrality functions that do not increase monotonically with the number of
 terms in a relevant sum (which, as will be discussed in the following section, is
 a standard form a centrality function takes). For instance, closeness centrality is
 equal to an inverse of a sum of paths from a node to the rest of a network. If a
 node does not have a path to at least one other node, then the closeness centrality
 of such node is equal to zero a result one may want to avoid. To go around this
 issue, usually only distances to reachable nodes are accounted for. We call this
 65
type of centrality shortest-path-based centrality.
 4.3 Some Standard Measures of Centrality
 Since a large variety of centrality measures exists, a thorough review is left out of
 this thesis. Here an emphasis is put on centralities that consider paths originating
 or terminating at a node to evaluate its importance. Indeed, many centrality mea
sures are based on either the shortest paths in the network or spreading processes,
 such as di usion or broadcasting. An extensive review of a variety of centrality
 measures can be found in [92]. Some traditional centrality measures are outlined
 in Table 4.1. Note that these measures assume undirected, unweighted network
 with one strongly connected component.
 Often measures that are formulated for undirected networks can be used in
 directed networks without changes. Furthermore, some centrality measures, such
 as PageRank [94], demand directionality. What directionality of edges means is
 that A= AT. Measures, given in Table 4.1 are then measures related to paths
 which originate at a node, and, since the networks we are interested in are DAGs,
 they point forward in time to nodes future. Let us call such measures future
 centrality and denote them by C(future)1.
 When centrality of a node is revealed through paths which end at that node,
 we can reverse the direction in the de nitions, use dvu instead of duv to quan
tify how central u is. In the space-time picture of DAGs, when duv is a path
 directed to u s future, then dvu starts in the past of u. Let us call such central
ity past centrality and denote such functions C(past). Instead of changing
 duv to dvu in the formulation of centrality one can simply reverse the direction
 1Note that the de nition of PageRank in Table 4.1 is related to nodes successors, or nodes
 it points to. This is opposite to the original de nition, used for search engine in Google. It is
 due to our opposite convention. Originally, in a website network an edge (uv) indicates that a
 website u is referenced in a website v.

 Erev = (vu)(uv) E . Similarly, if centrality of a node depends on both, its
 future and its past sets, the scores of past centrality and future centrality may be
 joined into a global total centrality score. For example, one can de ne it as
 C(total)(u) = C(past)(u) + C(future)(u).
 It is worth highlighting that both closeness centrality and harmonic closeness
 centrality should be slightly modi ed to be useful in DAGs, which are always
 67
weakly connected networks2. Both functions are supposed to give a mean value
 of the length of paths originating or ending at a node, which holds true only
 when a network is strongly connected [95]. When it is weakly connected, we
 can normalise future closeness centrality with F(u) instead of N 1 and future
 harmonic closeness centrality with 1 ( F(u)) instead of 1 (N 1) (refer to Table
 4.1 for the de nitions of these measures). This is a convention we will use in this
 chapter.
 Without the loss of generality, in this chapter we will also concentrate on
 future centrality unless otherwise stated. Any of our arguments can be
 translated to past centrality as we simply need to change from G to Grev.
 Future centrality will be denoted C(future); C(future) : C(future)(Gu) 
past centrality is de ned as C(past) : C(past)(Grev u)

 Figure 4.1: An illustration of how centrality measure can be used to obtain an
 order of nodes a centrality order. On the left, there is no notion of an order
 (rank) in the network. Centrality of nodes (in this example, eigenvalue centrality)
 provides scores for each node, as shown in the middle gure. These scores are
 used to order nodes from the most central, e in this case, to the least central, d
 in this case, see the gure on the right.
 It would be cumbersome to analyse all existing centrality measures, so in
 the further analysis, we will limit ourselves to the seven measures outlined in

 network is called weakly connected if replacing all its directed edges by undirected edges the
 result is a strongly connected undirected graph.

Table 4.1. As mentioned earlier, most centrality measures are derivatives of these
 fundamental centrality measures. The extent to which our results apply to
 other centrality measures is a task left for future studies.
 It will be useful to consider centrality as a function that creates a preorder:
 nodes of a network are (partially) ordered given a centrality function. We will call
 this order a centrality order. See Fig. 4.1 for an illustration of how eigenvalue
 centrality measure can impose an order of nodes in a directed network.
 4.4 DAGs and Standard Measures of Centrality
 Centrality provides many interesting insights about nodes in our DAGs. A cen
tral paper in terms of an out-degree in a citation network may be considered an
 important paper in a research eld [85]. A central species in terms of degree
 in a food web is an actively participating species and changes to the abundances
 of such species directly a ect many other species [96]. A central package in
 a network which represents software package dependencies is a software package
 which is a prerequisite to many other software packages.
 Centrality in directed acyclic graphs is not a new topic. A large contribution
 to the study of centrality in DAGs comes from bibliometric studies of citation
 networks. In a citation network, nodes out-degree (the number of times a node is
 cited) is a well-known indicator of its impact [85]. What type of impact citation
 count indicates exactly is not entirely clear. For instance, Leydesdor et al. argued
 that citation is a composite indicator: short-term citations can be considered as
 currency at the research front, whereas long-term citations can contribute to the
 codi cation of knowledge claims into concept symbols [97]. Recently, degree in
 citation networks was also used as a predictor of scienti c awards winners [98].
 Degree is not the only centrality measure used in DAGs. With several excep
69
tions, one can use almost any centrality measure. One particular counter-example
 is eigenvalue centrality. Here centrality of a node is given by the corresponding
 eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. As the adjacency matrix of any DAG is upper
triangular, it is also a nilpotent matrix with no non-zero eigenvalues, so all nodes
 are given centrality of zero.
 Some centrality measures, such as PageRank, are used o-the-shelf to study
 citation networks [99; 100]. However, quite often some adaptions of centrality
 measures also take place. These changes account for the bias created by the
 arrow of time. It is well-known that old nodes are more likely to be indicated
 as central. Some measures that account for this e ect include time-rescaled
 PageRank [101; 102], VoteRank [103].
 TR (see section 1.3.1) and its e ect on citation count was also studied [71].
 reduced degree is the degree of a node after transitive edges [31] are removed
 from the network. The so-called reduced citation count may be related to the
 topic diversity of a publication [71].
 Whencentrality measures account for the age bias they are treating symp
toms rather than healing the disease . Here the disease is that the topological
 order, an inevitable element of DAGs, creates the older is more central e ect. In
 the following sections we will try to uncover the relation between the topological
 order on the centrality order. We will also address potential treatments which can
 help reveal truly central nodes.
 4.4.1 Centrality Axioms for DAGs
 To understand the mechanisms of centrality we will begin by formulating axioms
 for a function to be called a centrality measure. Based on work on general cen
trality axioms, here we list an adapted, DAG-speci c axiom list.
 70
1. Isomorphic property. If graphs GH are isomorphic graphs, centrality
 scores are equal. Isomorphic graphs are such that contain the same number
 of nodes and edges. Furthermore, there is a function f which maps each
 node v of the rst graph to a node f(v) in a second graph in such a way,
 that if (uv) EG, (f(u) f(v)) EH. We say that this function is a
 structure-preserving bijection. Then centrality of a node v G should be
 equal to f(v) in H: C(Gv) = C(Hf(v)) v G.
 2. Locality. Future centrality of a node v depends only on the connections to
 its future:
 C(future)(Gv) = C((VE) v)
 (4.2)
 = C((F(v) v (uw)uw E if uw F(v) v v))
 An equivalent axiom for C(past) is constructed by replacing G with Grev.
 Similarly, total centrality of v must only depend on the union of nodes
 future and past. This axiom necessitates that centrality of a node must
 depend on paths related to it but should not be perturbed by any change
 in the part of a network, that is not connected to the node.
 3. Isolated minima. Centrality of a node v is zero if v is isolated, that is,
 (uw) 
E where u = v or w = v uw V. If future (past) of a
 node v is an empty set, its future (past) centrality, respectively, is mini
mal: C(future)(Gv) = min(C(G)) if F(v) = (similarly if P(v) = ). Of
 course, we can be less strict and ask only for a minimal centrality, rather
 than its value to be zero.
 4. Edge monotonicity. For a network G = (VE), vu V, (uv) E, adding
 an edge (uv) increases C(past)(v) and C(future)(u). This axiom requires that
 the larger the number of connections a node has, the more central it is.
 71
5. Impact range. A centrality measure is long-range if a local perturbation
 has a non-diminishing e ect at large distances. Consider two graphs, G :
 (uv V;v u;(uv) E) and G :(V;E (uv) ). Suppose further that
 z y F(u); z y. Then centrality measure is considered long-range if
 C(G z) C(Gz)<C(G y) C(Gy)
 (4.3)
 If the reverse is true, centrality is short-range. Note that centrality measure
 can be either short-range or long-range, so this axiom should be looked at
 as a classifying axiom.
 We can use DAG centrality axioms for a systematic analysis of centrality
 measures: if a centrality function does not admit at least one of the axioms, we
 would say that it cannot be a centrality function. For instance, these axioms
 would show that closeness centrality, as de ned in Table 4.1, is not a measure of
 centrality in DAGs, whereas the modi ed version, which was described in section
 4.4, would be a valid centrality measure.
 4.5 Centrality and Topological Order
 Let us now turn our attention to the relation between order, created using cen
trality, and the topological order. We will do so via the study of the ephemeral
 element of centrality the neighbourhood inclusion preorder. We will discuss in
 detail what it is, and how it acts in directed networks. Lastly, we will show how
 the centrality order is dictated by the topological order of nodes. We will often
 discuss a nodes index (de ned in section 1.3.1) as an indicator of its position in
 the topological order. Recall that the index is de ned as a nodes position in the
 topological order. We will use the convention that the index begins at the oldest
 node.
 72
4.5.1 Directed Neighbourhood Inclusion Preorder
 Neighbourhood inclusion, introduced in section 4.3, states that if we have a pair
 of nodes for which the neighbourhood inclusion preorder exists, the centrality
 function should order nodes such that the one with the larger neighbourhood has
 a larger centrality score, regardless of the choice of a centrality measure.
 Schoch and Brandes discussed the neighbourhood inclusion in terms of an
 undirected, strongly connected network [91]. In DAGs we have three neighbour
hoods to consider, namely, Nsuc(u)Npre(u)N(u) for each u G. Intuitively, if a
 centrality score is based on nodes future, we should consider Nsuc(u), rather than
 its Npre(u) set, as the latter has little to do with nodes centrality score. In a DAG
 no paths that start at a node ever return to it, so centrality of u only depends on
 its successors, successors of those successors and so on (as is also required by the
 axiom 2 from section 4.4.1). If in an undirected network u is a neighbour of v as
 much as v is a neighbour of u, in directed networks, nodes predecessors are not
 equivalent to nodes successors and this asymmetry needs to be accounted for.
 Let us consider all possible two-neighbour con gurations and how the replace
ment of N by either Nsuc or Npre in (4.1) relates to an expected centrality order.
 The node con gurations are the following: u v, u Nsuc(v) (which also includes
 the case u F(v)), u Npre(v) (which also includes the case u P(v)). Let us
 also assume shortest-path-based future centrality. These node con gurations are
 given in Table 4.2.
 In the case when u v ( rst and second rows in Table 4.2), neither u is a
 successor of v nor u is a predecessor of v, we can only have Nsuc(u) Nsuc(v)
 or Nsuc(v) Nsuc(u). A node with a dominant open neighbourhood is that of a
 larger centrality. Thus the neighbourhood inclusion preorder works as expected.
 Similarly, in the cases shown in rows three and four, centrality orders are also
 validated correctly by the inclusion preorder of successors.
 73
Note there is a special case, given in the last row of the table, when the
 original neighbourhood inclusion preorder is inconclusive. The issue created by the
 directionality of edges is related to the size of neighbourhoods. In the last row of
 the table we have two valid neighbourhood inclusions: w
 Nsuc[v] 
C(future)(u) 
uwv (Nsuc(u) 
C(future)(v), which allows C(future)(v) > C(future)(u)), but
 also uw = uw (Nsuc(v) = Nsuc[u] 
C(future)(v) = C(future)(u), which
 forbids C(future)(v) > C(future)(u)). Of course, we could simply choose C(future)(v) =
 C(future)(u), or choose not to compare the neighbourhoods of two nodes. However
 in simple cases of out-degree centrality and Katz centrality C(future)(u) is always
 smaller than C(future)(v) in such two-node con guration.
 To avoid the confusion, we may add a second requirement for the directed
 neighbourhood inclusion preorder, namely that a node on the right-hand
side of the (4.1) must be that of the larger open neighbourhood. Such choice
 removes the ambiguity in the case shown in the fth row of Table 4.2, as we then
 consider the following neighbourhood inclusion condition: Nsuc(u) Nsuc[v] but
 not reverse. Here node u can be less central, as is the case for out-degree centrality,
 or as central as v, which is the case in harmonic closeness centrality.
 Each centrality measure is di erent and the orders created by various central
ities will di er. However what directed neighbourhood inclusion preorder requires
 is that nodes, for which a given neighbourhood preorder exists, are ordered with
 respect to the neighbourhood inclusion preorder in the centrality order.
 4.5.2 Centrality without Neighbourhood Inclusion Preorder
 We know that if neighbourhood inclusion preorder exists for two nodes, then
 centrality must respect the preorder for these nodes. However, in DAGs the notion
 of neighbourhoods of uv are not always needed to compare their centrality. This
 information is already encoded in the topological order.

 HC (w) and the values of centrality
 are not entirely predetermined by the relative positions of the two nodes. In
 future harmonic closeness centrality, we need to evaluate the successors inclusion
 preorder in order to nd out which of the two nodes is more central.
 In this section we showed that in some cases, such as for Katz centrality
 measure, the directed neighbourhood inclusion preorder need not exist to order
 two neighbouring nodes based on their centrality scores. It suggests the relation
 between the order of centrality and the topological order of a DAG. However, it is
 worth pointing out that similar arguments derived for other centrality measures
 from Table 4.1 do not show obvious relation between the topological order of
 nodes and the centrality order. In light of this, the following section will consider
 correlations of centrality and topological order and will reveal the relationship
 between the two orders numerically.
 4.5.3 Centrality Correlations in DAGs
 It is well-known that centrality measures are inherently correlated [104; 105; 106].
 Amongst other analyses of centrality correlations, such work was also done in
 DAGs, in the context of food webs [107]. Typically, Pearson or Spearman correla
tion coe cients are used to evaluate similarity of centrality values, obtained using
 77
various centrality measures on the same network. Here we will study correlations
 between centrality measures from Table 4.1 as observed in some networks from
 Table 1.1 and in random networks from section 1.3.3.
 Fig. 4.2 shows that centrality measures divide into several similarity classes:
 past centrality measures, future centrality measures, and centralities, related to
 both futures and pasts of nodes. Past centralities, such as past harmonic closeness,
 in-degree, in-PageRank are correlated. Likewise, future centralities form a block of
 similar measures. Two measures based on both in- and out-going paths are degree
 and betweenness centrality. These measures also seem to be positively correlated.
 We see that node index is positively correlated with past centrality measures
 and negatively correlated with future centrality measures. These correlations are
 expected: as the arrow of time is in the same direction as the increasing index,
 older nodes have larger out-degrees. As the index of a node increases, its out
degree and future set decrease, while in-degree and past set increase.
 This correlation analysis is a proof that topological order and centrality order
 are correlated in a wide range of DAGs. Future centrality of an old node is larger
 than that of a recent one, as the former has a larger future light-cone than the
 latter. However we also discovered that in some networks the correlations between
 indices are stronger than in others, indicating that the e ect of the topological
 order on centrality order is not equally strong in all networks.
 4.5.4 Mutual Information Between Centrality and Topo
logical Order
 If we expect the observed centrality score of a node to be strongly inuenced by its
 position in the topological order, we may want to quantify this inuence, as it may
 di er from node to node. In order to separate topological order and the centrality
 order, we can think in terms of comparing ranks. How much topological order

reordering is required to recover the centrality order? Statistical tests of rank
 comparison, such as Kendalls [108], would be appropriate, however these tests
 are limited to comparison of total orders, whereas we have partial orders.
 Instead, we will consider mutual information between posets: if they are
 equal, the mutual information between them will be maximal and we can say
 that centrality order does not provide any new information about our nodes. We
 will take the approach proposed in [109] to compare our two partial orders: one,
 obtained from centrality and second, the intrinsic order of the DAG. To illustrate
 this idea we will employ a running example of out-degree centrality in the network,
 generated using the Price model with N = 5000m = 5p = 0625.
 First, we build a DAG with nodes of the original network and edges which
 represent the partial order of centrality. We will say that if C(Gu) > C(Gv),
 then (uv) EC, where EC is a set of edges in the new DAG. Whenever we
 have a tie in centrality values, we do not connect the two nodes they form an
 antichain (see 1.3.1 for de nition). Note that in this centrality graph the directed
 neighbourhood inclusion preorder exists for all pairs (u v 
F(u) ). Let us
 denote the network as G and the centrality graph as GC. Having obtained GC we
 can compare it to G for future centrality and Grev for past centrality3. Thus we
 compare the closed future set of a node in GC, FC[u], to the closed future set of
 a node in the original G or Grev, FT[u]4.
 As in the original paper, we formulate the joint distribution between two
 random variables based on the sizes of the set intersections. More speci cally, we
 use two indicator variables iC(u) and iT(u), associated with each candidate in GC
 3In the original paper these sets are called down sets and a down set of a node contains all
 of its descendants.
 4Although previously, we used the notation of F[u] to note the future set of u, but for the
 clarity of this section we will use the subscript T in order to accentuate the topological order
 from centrality order. Furthermore, note that we need to look at the future set FT[u] de ned
 on G when considering future centrality and FT[u] de ned on Grev when the past centrality is
 considered.

all high degree nodes, as expected, are on the right sides of both gures, as they
 are dominating the majority of other nodes in the centrality order. However, the
 wide range of (HC(u) HCT(u)) HC(u) for those nodes is large, indicating, that
 in the Price model, old nodes (large future sets FT) are also important nodes and
 age can explain centrality. In comparison, if we allocate a random number as the
 centrality value of each node, the mutual information between this randomised
 centrality and topological orders is negligibly small.
 Information-theoretic analysis could be useful to evaluate how much informa
tion about a nodes apparent importance can be explained by its position in the
 topological order. The possible avenues with this approach are many and we did
 not exhaust all possibilities. For instance, we could use the ratio of HC(u) HCT(u)
 HC(u)
 to evaluate the condence level for the centrality value we have. Alternatively,
 we could weigh the obtained centralities with the ratio of the entropies HC HT.
 Lastly, we could analyse the temporal patterns of the conditional entropy for a
 single node to understand its peak importance periods.
 4.6 Other DAG Centralities
 In the previous section of this chapter, we have studied the shortest-path-based
 centrality behaviour in DAGs. Let us now turn our attention to potential new
 candidates of well-behaved DAG-speci c centrality measures. We have learnt that
 good centrality measures should order nodes in a way, respecting the neighbour
hood inclusion preorder, and provide information about the importance of nodes,
 not necessarily present in the topological order.
 84
4.6.1 Centrality Based on the Longest Paths
 The longest paths may be a more natural choice for geodesics , as discussed in
 Chapter 2. This fact gives us motivation to test whether the longest-path-based
 centrality measures provide useful insights about centrality of nodes in DAGs.
 However, to make this unconventional choice, we need to convince ourselves the
 change of paths produces a measure which calculates centrality. More speci cally,
 we want a measure which satis es DAG centrality axioms (thus is centrality), ad
heres to the directed neighbourhood inclusion preorder, and provides information,
 not attainable from the topological order.
 Let us rst consider adaptions of the measures we studied previously. For
 instance, closeness centrality based on the longest paths is de ned as
 C(future)
 C
 where dLP
 LP(u) = F(u)
 v G 
dLP
 uv
 (4.13)
 uv is the length of the longest path from u to v. We can similarly replace
 the shortest path with the longest path between nodes in a harmonic closeness
 centrality and betweenness centrality. In Katz centrality, 
> 1 indicates that
 longer paths are preferred over shorter paths. To adapt degree, we may want to
 consider transitive reduction (TR). Edges which remain in the network after TR
 are edges which participate in at least one longest path between some two nodes.
 Let us have a look at the behaviour of these new centrality measures to see
 whether the longest-path-based centrality is related to topological order in the
 network. Let us also denote these centrality measures with a superscript LP .
 For Katz centrality, as was shown in (4.5), when > 1, centrality of an
 older node is always larger than that of its successor. Thus CLP
 K will be strongly
 a ected by the topological order of nodes and will likely be very similar to the
 shortest-path-based Katz centrality.
 85
Harmonic longest-path-based closeness centrality of a node u is related to
 centrality of its future neighbour v in a similar way as was shown in (4.6), however
 now the inequality is reversed, as the longest path dLP
 uv where v F(w) is at least
 equal to dLP
 wv +1 but can be longer (making CLP
 HC(u) smaller). So centrality of u,
 again, can be lesser or greater than centrality of its successors w.
 It is also not clear whether we prefer longer longest paths over shorter in
 centrality measures, such as closeness. If longer paths are preferred over shorter,
 the longest path centrality is likely to be strongly related to topological order of
 nodes. To see this, consider a simple future centrality, de ned as
 C(future)LP(u) =
 1
 F(u) v F(u)
 dLP
 uv 
(4.14)
 Intuitively, it calculates the average length of the longest paths, originating at
 u. We can show that in terms of w Nsuc(u), C(future)LP(u) C(future)LP(w),
 because the longest path from u to v F(w) will be via w or will be even longer:
 C(future)LP(u) 
1
 F(u) v F(u)F(w)
 dLP
 1
 F(u) v F(u)F(w)
 dLP
 uv + 1
 F(u) v F(w)
 (dLP
 uv + F(v)
 wv +1)
 F(u) (C(future)LP(w) + 1)
 (4.15)
 So there are some analytic indications that the longest-path-based centrality
 is inuenced by the topological order, similarly as the shortest-path-based central
ity is. Furthermore, correlation analysis in Fig. 4.5 shows a clear relation between
 the shortest-path-based centrality measures and their longest-path-based counter
parts. The longest-path-based centrality measures are also correlated with node
 indices, but this relation is likely to vary, depending on the network topology. In
 order to make use of centrality without topological order, simply replacing one

 4.6.2 Centrality Using Future and Past Sets
 Other features of nodes in DAGs are also worth considering for use in centrality.
 For instance, we can use the future (past) set and height (depth) of a node to
 de ne centrality in the following form:
 C(future)(u) = F(u) h(u) C(past)(u) = P(u) d(u)
 (4.16)
 Here h(u) and d(u) are, respectively, the height and the depth of a node u. Such
 centrality measures satisfy our directed neighbourhood inclusion preorder require
ment: for two nodes at the same height, depth, centrality depends only on their
 light-cone volumes F(u) or P(u). For nodes uv(uv) E, C(future)(v) is at least
 87
(h(u) + 1)( F(u) 1) but can be larger. Node u would be less central than v if
 all its neighbours are neighbours of v, but if some of them are not successors of
 v, u s centrality can be larger.
 Alternative DAG centralities could be based on a network after transitive
 reduction. Transitively reduced degree would satisfy directed neighbourhood in
clusion preorder, as whenever (uv) E in the graph after transitive reduction, we
 have Nsuc(u) = v . TR degree would also not be correlated with nodes index.
 4.7 Discussions
 Centrality as any other important concept is polysemous. Although much e ort
 has been put in nding the answer to a question of which centrality is appropriate
 in this situation? , not much work has been done for answering is centrality
 appropriate in this situation? .
 The aim of this chapter was to challenge the concept of centrality in ordered
 networks. We hope to have convinced the reader that centrality and the order
 of directed acyclic graphs are intertwined. We have shown this by analysing
 centrality axioms, the neighbourhood inclusion preorder and correlations between
 centrality measures and the topological order.
 Once the inter-connectedness between the two node orderings was revealed,
 we embarked on a search for a measure of centrality, not inuenced by the topo
logical ordering of nodes. We did it in a twofold way. First, in section 4.5.4
 we suggested evaluating the mutual information between two partial orders, one
 based on the topological ordering of nodes, and other, based on centrality. If a
 node is more central than would be expected from its position in the topological
 order, the lack of mutual information between the orders would signify its impor
tance. Secondly, in section 4.6 we looked at unconventional centrality measures
 88
that could potentially replace the traditional centrality measures. We concluded
 that centrality based on longest paths would also be related to the topological
 ordering of nodes.
